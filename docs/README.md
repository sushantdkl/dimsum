# Dim Sum Puri Documentation

This directory is the documentation hub for the Dim Sum Puri restaurant website and point-of-sale system. The application is built with Next.js 16 and React 19, uses PostgreSQL in production, and can fall back to SQLite for local development.

## Documentation rules

- Update the relevant document in the same change as code, schema, configuration, or workflow changes.
- Treat `migrations/` and `deploy/production_schema.sql` as the database implementation sources of truth.
- Treat `app/api/**/route.js` as the API implementation source of truth.
- Never place passwords, tokens, production URLs, customer data, or database dumps in documentation.
- Dates use ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`), amounts are stored as numeric values, and the application displays Nepalese rupees.
