/**
 * The single definition of "a bill that counts as trade", shared by every
 * reporting surface.
 *
 * Before this file existed, four surfaces each had their own idea:
 *
 *   Reports hub      status IN ('paid','partially_paid')                  created_at
 *   Analytics        + 'reopened','refunded'                              COALESCE(paid_at, created_at)
 *   Summary Report   + 'refunded'                                         created_at
 *   Dashboard        status IN ('paid','reopened')                        COALESCE(paid_at, created_at)
 *
 * So the same day produced four different revenue figures depending on which
 * page the owner opened, and a bill that was raised at 11pm and settled after
 * midnight fell on different days on different screens.
 *
 * The rules below are the agreed ones. Change them here and every report moves
 * together — that is the point of the file.

/**
 * Statuses that count as trade.
 *
 *  - paid            settled in full.
 *  - partially_paid  counted at FULL bill value. The sale happened; the unpaid
 *                    remainder is a receivable, reported separately as
 *                    outstanding dues. Revenue is not reduced by it.
 *  - reopened        a settled bill pulled back open for correction. Still a
 *                    real sale, and excluding it made bills vanish from reports
 *                    mid-correction.
 *  - refunded        still a real sale. The refund is reported as its own
 *                    deduction (see Refunds), so dropping the bill entirely
 *                    would double-count the reversal.
 *
 * Voided and cancelled bills are absent deliberately: those are bills that
 * should never have existed, as opposed to sales that were later reversed.
